        <p>
          T2 Interactive International Sdn Bhd incorporated on the 6th July 2013 is a spin-off from T2 Interactive Sdn Bhd to reflect expansion into Vietnam, Cambodia and eventually Laos and Myanmar.
          The key personnel and event management team at T2 Interactive International Sdn Bhd are the same people that started T2 Interactive Sdn Bhd in 2005.
          The Company started as a provider of BTL (below the line) of high end interactive equipment namely Ubiq Window, Catchyoo, Hologram to advertising & event management agencies. In 2006, T2 was transformed from being merely a BTL provider into a full-fledged event management company providing services from concept development; design, construction to final execution of the entire event.
